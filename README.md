# Arduino-Home-Automation

Smart Home Automation System using Arduino and IOT 

Introduction - 
  The increase in demand of service over the internet necessitated the data collection and exchange in efficient manner. In this sense internet of things (IOT) has promised the ability to provide the efficient data storage and exchange by connecting the physical devices via electronic sensor and internet. This is achieved by interfacing sensors like flex sensor, accelerometer sensor, magnetic sensor, flame sensor with microcontroller based system like Arduino UNO. The values from the sensor change the status of our appliances and the status of appliances.

Components and Software Used -  
  Arduino UNO, Relays, Breadboard, DC motor, Wi-Fi Module, Flame Sensor, Accelerometer, Motor Driver IC, Power supply, Arduino IDE,  LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), etcâ€¦

Specification of Components:
Specifications of some of the components used in this project are:

1.	Arduino UNO Board: The Arduino UNO board acts as a control unit in this experiment.
2.	Relays: Relays are often used in circuits to reduce the current that flows through the primary control switch. A relatively low amperage, e.g.: sensor can be used to turn a              much higher capacity relay on and off.
3.	Accelerometer: Accelerometers are devices that measure acceleration, which is the rate of change of the velocity of an object. They measure in meters per second squared (m/s2) or in G-forces (g). The values are represented in X, Y and Z coordinates. These values are used to control the rotation of motor.  
4.	Fire/Flame Sensor: A flame sensor "senses" a weak DC signal. This sensor is used to detect the fire in the house and then send an alert through buzzer.
5.	Wi-Fi module: The ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module is a self-contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your Wi-Fi network.
6.	Arduino IDE: The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board.
